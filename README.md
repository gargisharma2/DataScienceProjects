# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

# Overview
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin project aims to build a predictive model to classify tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The dataset includes various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

# Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
- Preprocess the data to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.
- Implement machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to classify tumors.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Files Included
- `breast_cancer_wisconsin.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset in CSV format.

# Teaching Ratings Dataset

# Overview
The Teaching Ratings project explores the relationship between professors' teaching ratings and various factors such as age, gender, and course difficulty. The dataset includes ratings given by students to professors at the end of their courses.

# Project Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends.
- Perform hypothesis testing to assess the significance of factors influencing teaching ratings.
- Build a linear regression model to predict teaching ratings based on available features.
- Visualize the relationships and provide insights from the analysis.

# Files Included
- `teaching_ratings.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset in CSV format.

# Penguins Size Dataset

# Overview
The Penguins Size project involves analyzing the Palmer Penguins dataset, which provides size measurements for three penguin species. The goal is to understand species differentiation based on physical measurements such as bill length, flipper length, and body mass.

# Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and species differentiation.
- Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group penguins based on size measurements.
- Build a classification model to predict penguin species based on the features.

# Files Included
- `penguins_size.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset in CSV format.

# Installation

To run these projects locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

# Usage

Each project is contained within its own Jupyter notebook. To explore the analysis:

1. Navigate to the desired project notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to see the code execution and output.
3. Modify the code and experiment with different techniques and models.
